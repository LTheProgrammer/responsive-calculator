# How to start

1 - git clone  
2 - navigate to /responsive-calculator  
3 - npm install  
4 - npm run dev  

If you encounter node issue, delete them, install a newer version of node (When developing this I had v22.16) close the terminal you were in until now.  
Restart your computer and redo step 2 to 4.
